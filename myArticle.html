		<h2>This Is My First Article</h2>

		<p class="quote">The attached who.csv dataset contains real-world data from 2008. The variables included follow. </p>

		<p>Country: name of the country LifeExp: average life expectancy for the country in years InfantSurvival: proportion of those surviving to one year or more Under5Survival: proportion of those surviving to five years or more TBFree: proportion of the population without TB. PropMD: proportion of the population who are MDs PropRN: proportion of the population who are RNs PersExp: mean personal expenditures on healthcare in US dollars at average exchange rate GovtExp: mean government expenditures per capita on healthcare, US dollars at average exchange rate TotExp: sum of personal and government expenditures.</p>

		<p>The LifeExp and TotExp are not linear related base on the plot.The residuals is not normality on the line in qqplot. The std of residuals isno’t round zero- line. Non assumptions of simple linear regression are met. Simple linear regression model isn’t fit to analyst this data.</p>

		<h2>This Is Another Article</h2>

		<p class="quote">Raise life expectancy to the 4.6 power (i.e., LifeExp^4.6). Raise total expenditures to the 0.06 power (nearly a log transform, TotExp^.06). Plot LifeExp^4.6 as a function of TotExp^.06, and r re-run the simple regression model using the transformed variables. Provide and interpret the F statistics, R^2, standard error, and p-values. Which model is “better?”</p>

		<p>After adjust the data, the LifeExp^4.6 and TotExp^.06 has a nearly linear relationship. Residuals in the adjusted data around the zero line and is normality on the line in qqplot. Residuals evenly around the zero line that met the assumption of homoscedasticity. </p>

		<p>Std residuals approched to zero. The data met all assumption of simple linear regression model.</p>
